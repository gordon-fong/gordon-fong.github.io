        <h2> Greetings! </h2>
        <p>
            I’m Gordon, grew up in New Plymouth and now based in Wellington. I have some background in animation and game development, with various part-time roles in between contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
            I haven’t had much practice with reflecting on what makes us who we are and why it shapes us so. I have always enjoyed working with others because everyone is different and unique. We all learn from each other and grow together. I love to see others grow and succeed, and I am truly grateful for all the people I have come across in my life that have shown me the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m at Dev Academy because I have dabbled with code in the past and would like to dive deeper to land my first job in this industry.
