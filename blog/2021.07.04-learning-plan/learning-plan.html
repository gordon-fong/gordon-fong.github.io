        <h2>
            Long term goal and career pathway
        </h2>
        <p>
            As a long term goal, I would like to fully understand and learn how to think like a developer. I hope to reach a stage where I may be able to logically break down any challenge presented to me and be able to assemble a solution, piece by piece. I hope to work in dynamic, yet flexible, environments and schedules. I hope to contribute to the people and communities around me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Front-end web development, software development and game development are career paths that I have taken an interest in. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Designing the visual layout and navigational structure of this blog has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I like the challenges it presents and how there are a multitude of approaches to tackling them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have always loved to create experiences, think outside the box and tell stories. One gateway is through game development. Games and creative media have always been a large part of my life. I am happy to see developers today push the boundaries and perspectives of what games are, what they can achieve, and how they can create a positive change in society. This is a pathway that I will undoubtedly be pursuing as a hobby, and if opportunity presents itself, as a career.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Personal learning strengths and limitations
        </h2>
        <p>
            I think my most prominent strength and weakness is being a perfectionist. In this sprint’s blog creation, I learnt a lot from my cohort and from sources online. I got my site to a working state quickly, but I spent a lot more time adjusting my site than was recommended. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it and it allowed me to cement what I learned by applying the knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another strength of mine is momentum. Once I get stuck into something, I am usually able to make a lot of progress and work for decent stretches at a time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The counter to my momentum is my weakness of getting distracted. Small breaks are fine, but anything more, and I start to lose my headspace. I often take a while to get back into a productive state after lunch.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Core skills to improve
        </h2>
        <p>
            I would like to be better at my communication. I often struggle to find words or end up tangling them when speaking. I’m not sure why it happens, but I’m aware that it is a problem. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Workload, work habits and routine
        </h2>
        <p>
            I will be on the campus as often as I can to study and work on my assignments. The campus provides a great environment to focus. Adding to this, I will do my best to leave my working mentality at the campus, creating a separation between my study/work and my personal life.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Workload, overcoming obstacles
        </h2>
        <p>
            If it is a problem that I seem to be stuck on, I will take a break and walk away for a bit to clear my mind and come back to it with a fresh perspective, and maybe with some extra help too.
        </p>
        <p>
            If it is the volume of work that is a problem, then I will spend time to identify what I need to accomplish the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and set that as my goal. Once I reach that goal, I will shelve it and revisit that work later when/if there is time.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Seeking aid
        </h2>
        <p>
            When I can’t find any answers myself and am in need of help, I will work my way down the list of sources to go through.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Cohort - I’ll ask my peers first. It is likely someone else has encountered the problem and we can work through it together.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Facilitator - If a facilitator is free, I’ll ask them and see what we can come up with.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Slack - The #Foundations channel has a ton of great minds!
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Expectations of the facilitation team
        </h2>
        <p>
            Perhaps learn some new concepts or current methodologies of applying our knowledge. I just hope they will be around to assist if/when needed and provide some insight and advice from their experiences about getting a job and working in the industry.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            External commitments
        </h2>
        <p>
            For the 15 weeks, I have cleared my schedule from as many external commitments as I can afford.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only commitments will be for family visits. These are currently unscheduled, but are likely to only fall within the weekend.
