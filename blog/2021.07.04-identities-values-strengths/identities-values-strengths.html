        <h2>
            Self-Evaluation
        </h2>
        <p>
            Some traits and values that have been identified through the tools used that I hold closest are creativity, harmony, emotional and team player.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think I am a creative individual at heart. I love to conjure up ideas and think of ways that will allow me to share these ideas with others. Most of these I have conveyed through artistic mediums in the past, generally drawings, animations and written narratives. I often let my emotions bleed into aspects of these mediums or immerse myself into feeling the emotions I am trying to convey. And expanding on that, I love collaborating with others to bring a shared idea to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am someone who seeks harmony and peace. I find confrontation uncomfortable and often unproductive. I am always open to discussion and critique and think I take it well, but with room for improvement. I find that sometimes I am held back from opening discussions with fears that it could lead to confrontations. Having identified this, I think I must learn to overcome this fear with practice and allow my emotions to extend and understand both sides so that change may be initiated constructively.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love to work with others and build something that communicates the ideas we share. I always do my best for the group, helping out where I can and appreciate it when others help me with aspects I struggle with. I think the main takeaway of this is that I aspire to grow in experience with others. I want to see everyone learn and become the best they can be and hope that that idea is shared amongst all of us.
        </p>
        <br>
            
        <h2>
            Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
        </p>
        <p>
            One ethical decision I had to make was deciding to leave my old job to come to study at Dev Academy. Teamwork was a core part of the job and leaving felt like I would be letting them down. I had grown close to the team and I was afraid of “hurt feelings” that may be felt. Ultimately, I wanted to pursue something more creative and different and I knew my old job would not fulfil that. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When I committed myself to leave and announced my departure, the team was fully supportive of my decision. I have met some great people from all backgrounds through my time there, and am thankful for all the support they have shown me throughout.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am thankful to be living in a changing era where people of all cultures and diversities are generally accepted in all aspects of life. I was drawn to arts and creative media early, and it grew with me. I was lucky enough to find people who shared my interests and worked together with them, sharing ideas and opinions. I’d like to think I influence others with my energy towards subjects and like to be influenced by the energy others show, to understand and empathize with them.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
        </h2>
        <p>
            My strengths are my dedication, being a teamplayer and being creative. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    My dedication will see me follow through and take in as much as I can during my learning journey.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Being a teamplayer is invaluable in everything in life. I want to work with my peers and create something greater than what we could have achieved alone. I want to see my peers succeed and grow, and hope they share this mindset.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Creativity allows me to view something from a different perspective. I like to think of alternative ways to approach things and hope to expand on ideas that others put forth.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            My limitations are limited patience, being a perfectionist and self-consciousness.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Everyone has their own limits with patience, but I think mine is shorter than average. I like building momentum and feel like I am constantly pushing forward. Encountering problems along the way is inevitable, but when a problem persists for an extended period of time, the frustration will seep in.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The creative side of me is double-edged. I constantly have a little voice echoing inside my mind that everything I do, could be done better. Making me spend more time on something than I really need to and pushes on the boundaries of my patience. It makes me hesitant to commit things and call them finished.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    I know that everyone is unique and works differently, but I subconsciously end up comparing myself to others, like I should be learning at a faster rate or not being good enough. Applying the growth mindset has helped subdue this somewhat, I just need more time and practice to truly grow into it. 
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
        </h2>
        <p>
            With the material I have gone through so far and my interactions with others from my cohort, being a teamplayer will be a great benefit. Everyone at EDA is so supportive, and the energy is infectious. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning obstacles will no doubt pop up and at different points for different people. I feel comfortable that I may not know or understand everything, but someone else may be able to explain it or we may be able to work through the problem together. I hope to find myself on both ends, seeking and bestowing help with my peers.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
        </h2>
        <p>
            I once was trying to work on a paired project with a classmate assigned randomly. The project spanned several weeks. My project partner was difficult to get in contact with and their attendance in class was below minimal. As the project progressed, I ended up taking on more and more of the workload. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With their growing absence, I came to accept that they would not be participating in the assignment. I dedicated myself to completing the assignment myself. This led to some unhealthy work hours, but eventually I finished it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to understand why my project partner had this behaviour and wanted to help them, but the lack of responses and commitment only frustrated me further. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I think I was too soft and that it was partly my fault for allowing it to happen. If this were to happen again, I think I would still try to understand and help my project partner, but would have been more assertive in stating expectations. I think my attempts at communication could have been improved on my end and we should have planned compromises as the project developed.
        </p>
