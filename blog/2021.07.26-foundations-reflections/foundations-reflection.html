        <h5>
            July 26, 2021
        </h5>
        <h2>
            What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have learned that I really enjoy sharing and expanding my knowledge with others. A few times during our javascript sections, I think I have aided others in their understanding and development of breaking down problems. When I help, I exercise the listening and looping aspect along with emotional intelligence to understand their approach and how they feel about it so we can pursue this path together. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In turn, I feel this has improved my confidence and allowed me to practice my communication skills, in terms of explaining ideas and concepts in simple ways. And through this, I have also learned that I really like analogies! I found that it's a great way to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            I realised that a lot of the time in the past, I had a fixed mindset. This often came from seeing great art and I would think “Wow, this looks really cool. I wish I could do that.” Being aware of neuroplasticity and making an effort to maintain a growth mindset has given me a lot of motivation to take small steps towards accomplishing big goals.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I think all of these are most important when working in a team environment. The values we bring contribute to what we can offer to the team. Empathy us to understand how the team is feeling / thinking so everyone works better together. Self awareness of our own strengths and limitations help keep us on task and shapes how we might approach a problem. Being self aware of our own fatigue and emotional balance is also important to take proper care of ourselves.
        </p>

        <h2>
            What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
            A couple things. How in depth the learning goes and how much I struggled with it. I think it has helped the most with making me aware of where and how to get my motivation. Something that will be very important in bootcamp, I’m sure.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have struggled the most with putting my thoughts into words and really diving deep as to how I feel about certain aspects.
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        </h2>
        <p>
            To prepare us for employment. The fact that employers view the hard/technical skills second to being a good person, has popped up a few times. The technical training can be learned on the job, but being someone that people want to work with is what gets people jobs in general.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
        <p>
            The time spent on core was worth it. I have been spending what feels like the most time on these sections. I think they are important to learn to be aware of and a good change of pace away from code.
