        <h5> July 28, 2021</h5>

        <h2>
            What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I think my ultimate goal would be to get into game development. I believe that is where my skill set and way of thinking can be the most effective. I realize that this is an industry that will be difficult to find a position in, but is pursuable as a hobby too (until a job opens up!). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Front-end development is still up there in terms of what I enjoy coding the most (so far!). I have an appreciation of UI and UX design. Though I only have limited knowledge of it at this point, I would like to explore this area further.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I’m managing my perfectionist habit differently. I’m quite selective now in what I decide to spend my time on. Our current website, tech blogs, and minesweeper were things that I have chosen to spend the most time on so far. I set myself a time limit on any extras and only really work on them whenever I have time to spare.
        </p>
        <p>
            Momentum is still there, but so are the distractions! Though the ‘distractions’ have become more constructive and relevant to learning :D
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Speaking in front of the group. I’m not great at public speaking and my nerves usually make me trip and stumble over my words. This may be less of a problem than earlier though, as I’ve now had the privilege of meeting and getting to know about half the cohort over the last few weeks in foundations.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I definitely want to develop my communication and leadership skills. I think these are the two I lack the most of. I think I give and receive feedback okay, but there is room for improvement.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
        </h2>
        <p>
            To be there when help is needed and to guide us in case we stray off the track. I’ll be making these efforts myself as well, but I may not always succeed.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
        </h2>
        <p>
            I hope to grow in the non-technical aspects. It will ultimately be up to myself to step up when the time comes to take advantage of these opportunities. I reckon that maintaining a growth mindset and being open to new experiences are what will get me through and get the most out of bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
            For managing the workload, I need to write up realistic timeboxes, stay within them and stay on task (when not on a break!). I am always open to helping and will learn to voice my own struggles earlier so I don’t fall behind and get overwhelmed.
