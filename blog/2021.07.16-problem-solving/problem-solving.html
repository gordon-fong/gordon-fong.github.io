        <h2>
          Experience of getting stuck on a simple problem...
        </h2>
        <p>
          I got stuck on the Gradebook stretch challenge. I was confused at first because it was asking for something that I had done earlier. Strange right?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">-</p>
        <p>
          It’s like parking your car in clear view of your friend’s house, and then sometime later they ask, “Hey, where’s your car?” 
        </p>
        “Just out in the front,” you say.
        <p>
          “I don’t see it,” they reply. (This here is our metaphorical error message!)
        </p>
        <p>
          Now a bunch of things are happening in our mind. We know we parked outside. We think our friend must just be ‘innocently’ mistaken. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So we go to correct them by pointing out (<span class="code-excerpt">console.log</span>ging) our car... 
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">
          Wait... Where IS our car?
        </p>
        <p>
          A brief burst of panic sets in.
        </p>
        <p>
          We frantically backtrack in our mind, pointing out where we’ve been and how we got to where we parked our car. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">
          Everything seems to be in order...
        </p>
        <p>
          We look at where our car should be again. <span style="font-style: italic;">Still empty. Yep.</span>
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">
          What could have possibly happened to it?
        </p>
        <p>
          We pace back and forth, trying not to get frustrated. We have a cup of tea to reset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we think back to our time spent at our friend’s place. They disappeared for five minutes a little while ago without explanation. That’s pretty sus.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Where did you go earlier?” We ask.
        </p>
        <p>
          A smirk creeps across their face. “To move your car...”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">-</p>
        <p>
          Long story short, it was a simple problem that made me sweat and doubt what I did earlier. I took the time to comb over the tests, line by line and see that my gradebook object was emptied out along the way. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn’t help but laugh a little as to how this little detail had eluded me for so long. Once found, everything made sense and all I had to do was restate what I had done earlier, inside a <span class="code-excerpt">function</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Or in other words, I just had to park my car again!
        </p>

        <p>
          I learnt to be more thorough and not get too tunnel-visioned from this exercise. Overall though, that was a really sneaky move and just a little evil. I like it... >:)

        <h2>
          Solving a problem with elegance...
        </h2>
        <p>
          Pseudocoding the FizzBuzz challenge! I spent a lot of time thinking of and writing out simple steps of how I’ll approach both parts of this challenge, following the expression of, "measure twice, cut once". 
        </p>
        <p>
          I discovered many sub-steps I hadn’t thought about initially by simply running through the logic one step at a time. I was constantly asking myself, <span style="font-style: italic;">what do I need here?</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">where should this go?</span> It was actually quite a soothing experience walking through it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I was happy with what I had, I converted it directly to code and it was so satisfying to see (almost) everything slot perfectly in place! 
        </p>

        <h2>
          My comfort level with problem solving techniques and process
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Pseudocode
        </h2>
        <p>
          Pseudocode is incredibly useful! I find most of the core issues I may encounter with this method, saving time while actually coding. 
        </p>
        <h2>
          Trying something
        </h2>
        <p>
          This pairs well with googling! I usually do this by trying a different approach I understand to get past a small issue so I can tackle the bigger problem. I shelve the original approach and investigate why that particular method didn’t work compared to the alternative, later on.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Rubber ducky method
        </h2>
        <p>
          I use it without knowing. I need more practice using this method consciously. Solves many problems I easily overlook.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Reading error messages
        </h2>
        <p>
          I always read the messages, but I should expand my knowledge of what they consist of. I just pick out key parts such as the type of error (an undefined variable 99% of the time...), the file’s name of where it is occurring, and the line number inside that file. This helps triangulate my focus.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Console.logging
        </h2>
        <p>
          I like being able to see what I’m doing at each step. I have a bad habit of inserting a console.log after every line of code. Worst of all, I don’t always remember to remove them after xD
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m working on the clean up!
        </p>
        <h2>
          Googling
        </h2>
        <p>
          Google is great! With practice, I’ve been able to be more specific in my searches. I normally look up the MDN documentation first, trying to understand the fundamentals of how something works first and then try solutions from there.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Asking your peers for help
        </h2>
        <p>
          I will only ask after I try and fail the solo methods first. However, if someone asks me for help, I drop everything and see if we can work it out together haha.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Asking coaches for help
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is my last resort when approaching new problems, but I’ll ask for some more clarification to further my knowledge or why a certain approach doesn’t work compared to something else.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Improving your process with reflection
        </h2>
        <p>
          Reflecting on what worked and what didn’t helps me repeat the same mistakes less often. Good to refer back to them every now and again.
        </p>
