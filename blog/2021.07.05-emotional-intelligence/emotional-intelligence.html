            What is Emotional Intelligence?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the ability to pick up on signs, control your own and evaluate how to act on emotions. It is an important part of life and research shows it to be a large factor in the ability to be hired and improve your career. Some people may innately have more capability than others but it is a skill that can be trained with practice. 
        </p>

        <h2>
            How is it different to IQ?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Unlike EQ, IQ is based on oneâ€™s ability to learn, understand and apply information to skills such as word comprehension and mathematics. It is all about cognitive functionality. 
        </p>
        <p>
            EQ identifies people with leadership/teamwork skills or who have social challenges. IQ identifies gifted individuals or individuals who have mental challenges. 
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>
            Why is it important?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Emotional intelligence is important for our success in life and our own wellbeing. Emotions left unchecked lead to imbalance and we lose our control over where our mindset sits. If we are able to identify and control what we feel, we can set ourselves in a positive state. Good leaders can empathize and understand the people around them and help them also achieve this state.
