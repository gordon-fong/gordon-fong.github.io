        <h2 style="text-align: center;">
            Neuroplasticity

        <h2>
            How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?
        </h2>
        <p>
            When people learn how their brain works, they become more motivated and open to learning, knowing that everyone possesses the ability to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being actively aware of how you learn benefits the learning process.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also something that aids in the recovery after accidents, or to overcome disabilities.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            How might I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my own benefit?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Doing these reflections is a very effective way of engaging with neuroplasticity. Reflecting on new material allows me to traverse the pathways I have just made and strengthen them, allowing me to digest the information more effectively.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            What are some of the ways to increase my neuroplasticity?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Practice what I have learnt over the day. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Think about how I could apply the new information into something practical, or into a personal project going forward.
        </p>

        <h2>
            What is it and why is it relevant?
        </h2>
        <p>
            It’s a way of thinking. To understand and accept that we may not know everything, but we all possess the ability to grow and learn new things to become better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone is unique in their way of learning. It is important to understand what is most effective for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s oozing with positive VIBES and motivation!
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            Did anything surprise or change for me?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Prior to knowing about the two mindsets, I think there are times where I would fall into the fixed category. I will make active efforts to change my way of thinking until it becomes natural.
        </p>
        <p>
            I found it to be a positive and inspirational topic and fuel for motivation.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>
            How will I integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey?
        </h2>
        <p>
            One aspect of Carol Deck’s Ted Talk that I found fascinating was her example of the power of the word “yet”. It leaves a pathway open to success. I know that there will be aspects to this course that I will struggle in, but I will choose to embrace the challenge and persevere through obstacles, knowing that I will get there in my own time.

            Reflecting on how these understandings may shape or influence my learning plan and strategy.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Understanding Neuroplasticity and developing a Growth Mindset are important for motivation. Covering both of these topics was a positive and inspirational experience that got me pumped for learning!
        </p>
        <p>
            When my code breaks (which is always!), I will remain positive! Or at the very least delay frustration because I know that I WILL understand why and fix it (eventually)!
